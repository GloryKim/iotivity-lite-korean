# 온 보딩 과정 상세 설명


1. 실행 예시 바탕으로 설명을 계속 하겠다.

2. 다음 과정은 이렇게 부른다. **서버 온보드 및 프로비저닝**

3. 맨처음 **./onboarding_tool**를 입력한다. 그리고 숫자 1를 입력한다.

Onboarding and Provisioning
----------------------------
Runing the onboarding tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At this time there are three versions of the onboarding tool.  The command line C version, the
command line Java version, and the GUI Android version. Both command line versions are identical.
It does not matter which version of the onboarding tool is used.

The C version of the onboarding tool can be found in ``<iotivity-lite>/port/linux`` see Linux build
instructions.

A Java version of the onboarding-tool can be found in
``<iotivity-lite>/swig/apps/java_onboarding_tool``

The following instructions assume the onboarding tool has been built and can run.

Simple Step-by-Step guide for onboarding and provisioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This guide assumes you are starting one discoverable device at a time. Multiple devices can be
discovered and onboarded at the same time however it becomes the responsibility of the user to
figure out which UUID belongs to which device.

Once you have successfully onboarded the samples the first time using the following step-by-step
options feel free to RESET the devices and play around with different provisioning options.

The below steps use the command line version of the onboarding tool. The steps for the Android
onboarding tool is very similar but are not described here.

(Step 1) Onboard and Provision the Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are multiple methods to onboard and provision server and client samples.  Below is given one
of the many possible ways the this could be done.

 - start the server sample
 - start onboarding tool it will print a menu with many option
 - Type ``1`` **Enter** to ``Discover un-owned devices``
 - Type ``8`` **Enter** to *Take ownership of device*

   + Type ``0`` **Enter**. If you have multiple unowned devices you will have to select the correct
     device from the list.

 - Type ``4`` **Enter** to ``Discover owned devices`` the device you just took ownership of should be
   listed.
 - Type ``13`` **Enter** to ``Provision ACE2``. There are many ways to properly provision the device.
   This will give instruction for using wildcard provisioning.

   + Type ``0`` **Enter**. If you have multiple unowned devices you will have to select the correct
     device from the list.
   + Type ``1`` **Enter** for an ``auth-crypt`` ACE
   + Type ``1`` **Enter** in response to ``Enter number of resources in this ACE:``
   + Type ``0`` **Enter** in response to ``Have resource href? [0-No, 1-Yes]:``
   + Type ``1`` **Enter** in response to ``Set wildcard resource? [0-No, 1-Yes]:``
   + Type ``2`` **Enter** to select the ``All discoverable resources`` option
   + Type ``0`` **Enter** in response to ``Enter number of resource types [0-None]:``
   + Type ``0`` **Enter** in response to ``Enter number of interfaces [0-None]``
   + Type ``0`` **Enter** for CREATE, ``1`` **Enter** for RETRIEVE, ``1`` **Enter** for UPDATE,
     ``0`` **Enter** for DELETE, and ``1`` **Enter** for NOTIFY.
   + ``Successfully issued request to provision ACE`` should be printed on the screen upon success

(Step 2) Onboard the client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - start the client sample
 - Type ``1`` **Enter** to ``Discover un-owned devices``
 - Type ``8`` **Enter** to *Take ownership of device*

   + Type ``0`` **Enter**. If you have multiple unowned devices you will have to select the correct
     device from the list.

  - Type ``2`` **Enter** to ``Discover owned devices`` the server and client should be listed

(Step 3) Pair Server and Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Start the client and server samples
  - Type ``12`` **Enter** to ``Provision pair-wise credentials``
  - Type ``0`` **Enter** ``1`` **Enter** to pair the client and server. If you have multiple owned
    devices you will have to select the correct devices from the list.

(Step 4) Restart and Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The samples should be onboarded and provisioned. Restart the server and then the client they should
discover each other and run without difficulty.
