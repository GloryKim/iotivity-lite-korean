(cmd를 하나 열고 똑같은 경로로 와서 **./simpleclent** 명령어를 입력한다.)
(경로는 ~/iot-lite/iotivity-lite/port/linux 로 고정이다.)
(그리고 다시 Onboarding cmd로 돌아와서 다음과 같은 숫자를 순서대로 작성한다.)

4 (이것도 공식문서에는 2 인가로 적혀있다. 잘못 적혀있으니 꼭 인지하자.)

(여기 까지 했으면 다음과 같은 글귀가 마지막에 나와야한다.)
Successfully provisioned pair-wise credentials
```

1. Server cmd와 Client cmd 창에 **ctrl+z** 키를 눌러서 종료를 일단 하고
다시 각각 cmd창에
- ./simpleserver
- ./simpleclient
두 명령어를 입력하여 실행을 하면 
서버 쪽에서는 GET_light를 출력하고
클라이언트 쪽에서는 key name, value John's Light를 포함해서 쭉쭉 통신이 진행 된 것을 확인할 수 있다.

2. 만약에 안 된다면 make clean과 make를 다시 진행해야한다.

3. 그래도 안된다면 **help.md**를 참고해라. 한번하면 두번은 할일이 없을것 이다.

4. 다음은 온 보딩 쪽 cmd 출력 화면이다.
